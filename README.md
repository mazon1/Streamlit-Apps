##  Machine Learning Applications Repository

Welcome to my Apps repository. This repository contains different machine learning applications that I have built and deployed. Each application has its own directory with its code, documentation, and deployment information.

# Applications List

## Text Generation App

This text generation app deployed on Hugging Face using FastAPI can be used to generate text content based on a specific input or prompt. The app uses a pre-trained language model, such as GPT-2 or GPT-3, to generate text that is similar in style and tone to the input.

Users can interact with the app using this [link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/text-generation) .
[Click on "Try it Out"](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/text-generation) .The app generates the text and displays new content based on the input text back to the user.

One potential use case for this app is for content creation, where a user might use the app to generate ideas for articles, social media posts, or other types of written content.

## Uplift Model

This application is an Uplift Model. Uplift modeling is used to identify the customers who are most likely to be influenced by the effect of an advertising campaign and to quantify the size of that impact. It has been deployed to Streamlit platform and can be accessed at [Uplift Demo App](https://mazon1-apps-appuplift-repmp3.streamlit.app/)

## Iris Model
This application is based on the famous Iris dataset [Iris App](https://mazon1-iris-app-wcsd77.streamlit.app/)


# Requirements
Each application has its own requirements, which can be found in their respective directories. In general, the following requirements are needed:

Python 3.8
Required Python packages, as listed in the requirements.txt file in each application directory
Any additional dependencies specific to the application.

# Installation

To run any of the applications in this repository, please follow these general steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/mazon1/Apps.git
Navigate to the directory of the application you want to run: cd application1
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Follow the specific instructions in the application's README.md file to run and use the application.
