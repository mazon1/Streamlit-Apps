### APPS: Machine Learning Applications Repository

Welcome to my Apps repository. This repository contains different machine learning applications that I have built and deployed. Each application has its own directory with its code, documentation, and deployment information.

Applications List
Application 1: This application is an Uplift Model. Uplift modeling is used to identify the customers who are most likely to be influenced by the effect of an advertising campaign and to quantify the size of that impact. It has been deployed to Streamlit platform and can be accessed at [Uplift Demo App](https://mazon1-apps-appapp-8sfsyx.streamlit.app/)
